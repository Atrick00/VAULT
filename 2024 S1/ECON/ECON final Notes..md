# Economics: Principles in Action (Chapters 1-8)

## Chapter 1: What is Economics?

### Scarcity
- The fundamental economic problem where limited resources cannot satisfy unlimited wants.
- Forces individuals and societies to make choices.
### Factors of Production

- Resources used to produce goods/services:
    
    - **Land**: Natural resources like water, oil, and forests.
        
    - **Labor**: Human effort, including physical and mental work.
        
    - **Capital**: Tools, equipment, and factories used in production.
        
    - **Entrepreneurship**: Innovation and risk-taking to create businesses.
        

### Opportunity Cost

- The next best alternative forgone when a choice is made.
    
- Examples: Choosing to work over attending school, buying coffee instead of saving money.
    

### Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)

- Graph that shows the maximum possible output combinations for two goods given fixed resources and technology.
    
- Concepts:
    
    - **Efficiency**: Points on the curve.
        
    - **Growth**: Shifts outward due to increased resources or technology.
        
    - **Opportunity Cost**: Slope of the curve shows trade-offs.
        

### Economic Systems

- **Traditional Economies**: Decisions based on customs and traditions.
    
- **Command Economies**: Central government makes all economic decisions (e.g., North Korea).
    
- **Market Economies**: Decisions based on voluntary exchange in markets.
    
- **Mixed Economies**: Blend of market and government involvement (e.g., the U.S.).

## Chapter 2: Economic Systems and Decision Making

### Market Economy

- Driven by individual choices and voluntary exchanges.
    
- **Adam Smith**: "Invisible hand" guides efficiency and innovation.
    

### Command Economy

- Centralized decision-making by government planners.
    
- Focus on equity but often lacks efficiency and freedom.
    

### Mixed Economy

- Combines elements of market and command systems.
    
- Balances individual freedom with government intervention.
    

### Economic Goals

- Key objectives include:
    
    1. **Efficiency**: Optimal use of resources.
        
    2. **Freedom**: Choice for consumers and producers.
        
    3. **Security**: Safety nets like unemployment benefits.
        
    4. **Equity**: Fair distribution of resources.
        
    5. **Growth and Innovation**: Economic expansion and technological progress.
        

### Role of Incentives

- Motivators that influence behavior:
    
    - **Market economies**: Profit motive.

### Public Goods

- **Characteristics**:
    
    - **Non-excludable**: Cannot exclude non-payers.
        
    - **Non-rivalrous**: Use by one does not reduce availability for others.
        
- Examples: Roads, parks, national defense.
    

### Market Failures

- Situations where markets fail to allocate resources efficiently.
    
    - **Externalities**: Costs or benefits that affect third parties.
        
    - **Monopolies**: Lack of competition leads to inefficiency.

## Chapter 4: Demand

### Law of Demand

- **Inverse Relationship**: As price decreases, quantity demanded increases.
    

### Demand Curve

- Downward sloping graph showing the relationship between price and quantity demanded.
    
- Movement along the curve: Caused by price changes.
    
- Shift of the curve: Caused by non-price factors.
    

### Determinants of Demand

1. **Income**: More income increases demand for normal goods, decreases for inferior goods.
    
2. **Consumer Expectations**: Future price expectations influence current demand.
    
3. **Population**: Larger population increases demand.
    
4. **Consumer Tastes**: Changes in preferences shift demand.
    
5. **Prices of Related Goods**:
    
	- **Substitutes**: Increase in price of one leads to higher demand for the other.
    
	- **Complements**: Increase in price of one leads to lower demand for the other.
    

### Elasticity of Demand

- Measures responsiveness to price changes:
    
    - **Elastic**: Quantity demanded changes significantly.
        
    - **Inelastic**: Quantity demanded changes minimally.

## Chapter 5: Supply

### Law of Supply

- **Direct Relationship**: As price increases, quantity supplied increases.
    

### Supply Curve

- Upward sloping graph showing the relationship between price and quantity supplied.
    
- Movement along the curve: Caused by price changes.
    
- Shift of the curve: Caused by non-price factors.
    

### Determinants of Supply

1. **Input Costs**: Higher costs decrease supply.
    
2. **Technology**: Improvements increase supply.
    
3. **Government Intervention**:
    
	- **Taxes**: Decrease supply.
    
	- **Subsidies**: Increase supply.
    

4. **Number of Suppliers**: More suppliers increase market supply.
    

### Elasticity of Supply

- Measures responsiveness to price changes:
    
    - **Elastic**: Quantity supplied changes significantly.
        
    - **Inelastic**: Quantity supplied changes minimally.
        

### Market Equilibrium

- **Equilibrium Price**: Point where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.
    
- **Surpluses**: Excess supply drives prices down.
    
- **Shortages**: Excess demand drives prices up.

## Chapter 6: Prices

### Functions of Prices

- Act as signals for producers and consumers.
    
- Incentivize efficient resource allocation.
    
- Serve as a mechanism for distribution.
    

### Price Ceilings

- Government-imposed maximum prices (e.g., rent control).
    
- Can lead to shortages and reduced quality.
    

### Price Floors

- Government-imposed minimum prices (e.g., minimum wage).
    
- Can lead to surpluses and inefficiency.
    

### Market Disequilibrium

- Occurs when supply and demand are imbalanced, causing:
    
    - **Shortages**: Excess demand.
        
    - **Surpluses**: Excess supply.
