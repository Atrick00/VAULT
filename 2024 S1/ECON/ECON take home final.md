Write 3-5 sentences answer each of these questions, demonstrate knowlage about each key idea in the prompts
	1. WHAT IS PROGRESSIVE TAXATION. GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRESSIVE TAX AND AN EXAMPLE OF A REGRESSIVE TAX (standard 12.3)
		1. Progressive taxation is a system where tax rates increase as income rises, so higher earners pay a larger percentage of their income compared to lower earners. This system aims to reduce income inequality by placing more of the tax burden on those with greater financial resources. For example, the U.S. federal income tax is progressive because tax brackets impose higher rates on higher incomes. In contrast, a sales tax is regressive because it disproportionately affects low-income earners, who spend a larger share of their income on taxable goods.
	2. WHAT IS CREATIVE DESTRUCTION? USING AN ORIGINAL EXAMPLE, SHOW YOU UNDERSTAND IT. Show a well labeled supply/demand curve of the displaced product.
		1. Creative destruction refers to the process where new innovations replace older industries or products, disrupting existing markets while driving economic growth. For example, digital streaming services like Netflix largely replaced DVD rental businesses by offering on-demand content. This innovation caused the demand for DVDs to fall, shifting the demand curve for DVDs to the left and lowering both their equilibrium price and quantity. Although disruptive, this process fosters progress by encouraging the adoption of better technologies.

	3. DESCRIBE WHAT AN ASSET BUBBLE IS? Describe 3 examples of asset bubbles - what asset was inflated, why did people invest in the asset, how did each bubble end?
		1. An asset bubble occurs when the price of an asset rises far above its true value due to speculation and excessive demand. For instance, the dot-com bubble of the 1990s inflated tech stock prices until they crashed when profits failed to materialize. Similarly, the housing bubble of the 2000s collapsed after risky mortgages led to widespread defaults. Tulip Mania in the 1630s saw tulip prices skyrocket before demand evaporated, leaving investors with worthless bulbs. Each bubble burst due to a sudden loss of confidence, crashing asset values.
	4. DISCUSS KEYNESIANISM, USING THE GDP EQUATION. Define each letter in the equation. Associate his theory with events in the 1930s or in 2008.
		1. Keynesian economics emphasizes government intervention to stabilize the economy, particularly during recessions, using the GDP equation: **GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)**. Consumption (C) is household spending, investment (I) is business expenditures, government spending (G) includes public projects, and net exports (X - M) accounts for trade. Keynes argued that increasing government spending (G) during downturns could boost demand, as seen during the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis. These interventions helped stimulate growth and reduce unemployment.
	5. DESCRIBE TWO WAYS TO PROFIT FROM OWNING A STOCK AND ONE WAY TO LOSE FROM OWNING IT. 
		1. Owning stocks can generate profit through dividends, where companies share their earnings, or capital gains from selling stocks at a higher price than purchased. Stocks also carry the risk of loss if their value decreases, resulting in a capital loss when sold. Additionally, a company in financial trouble might reduce or eliminate dividends, further diminishing returns for investors.
